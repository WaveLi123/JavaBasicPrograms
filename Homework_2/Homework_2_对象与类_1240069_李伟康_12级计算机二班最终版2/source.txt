<When I was just a little girl>
				--《后会无期》英文插曲
Que Sera Sera 
When I was just a little girl 
I asked my mother, What will I be 
Will I be pretty, will I be rich 
Here's what she said to me 
Que Sera Sera 
Whatever will be, will be 
The future's not ours to see 
Que Sera Sera,what will be will be 
When I grew up and fell in love 
I asked my sweetheart, What lies ahead 
Will we have rainbows day after day 
Here's what my sweetheart said 
Que Sera Sera 
Whatever will be, will be 
The future's not ours to see 
Que Sera Sera,what will be will be 
Now I have children of my own 
They ask their mother, What will I be 
Will I be handsome, will I be rich 
I tell them, Wait and see 
Que Sera Sera 
Whatever will be, will be 
The future's not ours to see 
Que Sera Sera,what will be will be 
Que Sera Sera
